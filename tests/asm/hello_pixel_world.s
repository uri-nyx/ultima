; Bare metal graphic hello world program for the Tale√§ system
; This program shows the system cannot keep up setting pixels
; until filling the screeen before the screen refresh.
; The Drivers for the video module should be used instead of writing pixels directly.
; e.g. a framebuffer and the blit method.

start:
